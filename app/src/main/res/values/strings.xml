        \n\nLord of the Rings type, the Chronicles of Narnia, in general stories where there is adventure and action.
        \nSo I enjoy them in books, movies, series or anime.
        \n\nSimply because it transports me to a world where everything is possible.
        \nAnd I also enjoy music and I like to sing.
        \nThe genres I consume the most are pop, rock, soundtracks and kpop.
        \n\nI can say that in general I am open in genres to see or hear but this predominates.
        \n\nWell, that's it.
